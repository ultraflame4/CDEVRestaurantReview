Of course, I also have heard of this place because of the Michelin guide and it being the first hawker stall receiving a coveted star. <br><br>I had to try it all - the soya chicken, the char siew, the roasted pork, and more. I had the soya chicken plate with the rice ($3.80 SGD) and the 3 way platter which comes with the char siew, roasted pork, and the pork rib ($10 SGD). It was amazing. You could really taste how different the soy sauce brew is, in comparison to other restaurants. The sauce is sweeter than most but with a very unique spice floral undertone. The char siew was amazing as well because of that unique soy sauce brew. The roasted pork is like any other in SG so you can totally skip this because I think they just have this, just to have people order it.<br><br>This place is crowded on the weekends and getting a table inside is quite difficult so to avoid the chaos, the best thing to do is order your food as take out and bring it with you to the nearby Chinatown Food Street.

Most dishes are S$3 and under. <br><br>Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well.

I did prefer the Beef Rendang ($28) a bit more overall, so I probably wouldn&#39;t order Buah Keluak Ayam on a subsequent visit. <br><br>To pair with these two dishes, my party got Chicken Rice Rice (rice from the Hainanese Chicken Rice) ($3) and Roti Prata ($2).

I don&#39;t want to recommend a specific one... I&#39;m sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? &#34;It&#39;s not going to be the same..&#34; I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn&#39;t... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. <br><br>The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails.

(IMHO*) <br><br>The bagels that were brought to the event were way beyond the normal plain bagel, and my friend and I were lucky enough to be the last to share a sundried tomato bagel - I highly recommend this because the bagel itself is so flavorful! It was a more DIY / pick-your-own-fillings at the event, which I liked because friend and I decided that we should share the bagel AND have two different flavours in one bagel as we didn&#39;t want to take one each - too much bagel for breakfast! <br><br>My office recently moved to somewhere near Icon where TMBH is located, in fact, we&#39;re practically across-the-road neighbors now! And, I had to had down to try at least one other bagel, right? Thus began the quest to find lunch buddies who wanted bagels too - which wasn&#39;t too hard because all I had to do was shout &#39;bagels for lunch?&#39; and I got a few brave volunteers that took the journey to TMBH with me. <br><br>There was a crowd! It was around lunch time and there were many other brave knights who had braved the CBD heat to Icon and were waiting be around for their orders. Even though TMBH has seats, not many were filled up because office people, we just like to have lunch in office (me especially, because what&#39;s a cafe in the office for if we don&#39;t use it!) <br><br>I got myself a Piglet to bring back and I swear, best piglet ever.

They serve their coffee with a standard double shot. While the kinds of food is not revolutionary, they do it very well.

There are different sections to it, given the older colonial nature of the building, but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city-state itself.

Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good.

We did not touch the peanuts or the tea, so I had asked them to remove the charges (To their credit, the charges were removed). The point is this; a well run establishment shouldn&#39;t play these types of games just to make a couple extra bucks from their customers.

Â They know it too - they sell small jars of fresh kaya that can be carefully packaged for a long flight (well, Singapore&#39;s just one island, so all the flights are international). Â There&#39;s a number of things you can buy as gifts - I have actually done this and it&#39;s a great gift for friends or family.<br><br>Come to Killiney during morning primetime, and you&#39;ll likely be queuing up outside and/or hovering around a table waiting for people to finish feeding themselves. Â The queue for ordering food is also a bit annoying - it&#39;s disorganized and right next to people sitting at tables. Â Frequently you have to move around to let servers go by or let customers in/out. Â Considering the size of the place, this should be expected (and in Singapore space is at a premium), so it&#39;s not a huge issue. Â Your average hawker center probably has less room to maneuver.

Â The kaya is fresh and when combined with the melted butter, is heaven in your mouth. It&#39;s hard not to eat 2 of these french loaves when they&#39;re SUCH a good value. Â A french loaf, 2 eggs, and a kopi will be about half the price of any other sit-down breakfast in Singapore.

The shiro negi enhance the whole bowl which makes every bite so delicious. We had Grade A3 Sirloin (100g) in Sukiyaki style ($78) and Blackmore Ranch 220g ($85) as well.

There&#39;s also another carrot cake stall that&#39;s not bad, though it has been closed for a while. There&#39;s also the famous big prawn noodle, though I&#39;m not so hot on that. A lor mee stall just opened, that&#39;s not bad, though portions have been shrinking rapidly. The chicken rice store is also extremely popular, but I think it&#39;s by virtue of being around super long, and growing into a habitual taste. It&#39;s only so-so. I dabao it home for dinner every week too. Good kuehs and pancakes to buy as well, but I forget which stall. I always ask for the corner piece :)<br><br>Just try everything man.

It&#39;s a super dynamic place. Some stalls come (watch out for even 1.50 promotions lol, happened a few times this year), some go, some branch out, the staples stay... not too many stalls that it&#39;s overwhelming.

I normally don&#39;t like clams that much and I&#39;m so glad we got the medium size vs the small size. You get so much more value, and we struggled to finish it because of the generous portion (or it&#39;s just not a 2 person portion lol). Everything about it was perfect. I got to the point, even when there were empty shells, I picked it up with my chopsticks, put it in my mouth, and sucked all the sauce and juices because it was that dam good. I only stopped because my mouth was burning since it gets a bit spicy. For a person that doesn&#39;t like clams to do that, I don&#39;t think I need to say anymore. <br><br>The crab also was amazing. The pepper slowly builds up and combined with the spice from the clams, I was constantly reaching back for the bee hoon to drown out the spice. Still didn&#39;t match the first crab we had at Sin Huat Seafood, but was better than the New Ubin Seafood one. So #2 out of three really good crabs.
