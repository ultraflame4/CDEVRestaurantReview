It didn&#39;t seem fatty at all either, so seems like a dish I could eat every day of the week. <br><br>If you start getting familiar with hawker costs, you realize this place is double the price of other chicken, is it twice as good, probably not.

Of course, I also have heard of this place because of the Michelin guide and it being the first hawker stall receiving a coveted star. <br><br>I had to try it all - the soya chicken, the char siew, the roasted pork, and more. I had the soya chicken plate with the rice ($3.80 SGD) and the 3 way platter which comes with the char siew, roasted pork, and the pork rib ($10 SGD). It was amazing. You could really taste how different the soy sauce brew is, in comparison to other restaurants. The sauce is sweeter than most but with a very unique spice floral undertone. The char siew was amazing as well because of that unique soy sauce brew. The roasted pork is like any other in SG so you can totally skip this because I think they just have this, just to have people order it.<br><br>This place is crowded on the weekends and getting a table inside is quite difficult so to avoid the chaos, the best thing to do is order your food as take out and bring it with you to the nearby Chinatown Food Street.

Most dishes are S$3 and under. <br><br>Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well.

I don&#39;t want to recommend a specific one... I&#39;m sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? &#34;It&#39;s not going to be the same..&#34; I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn&#39;t... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. <br><br>The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails.

The eggs scrambled at the table with fried potatoes, brilliant idea, but the hot-plate wasn&#39;t hot enough to actually cook the eggs, so we had very raw egg white, slightly cooked egg-yolk, and brilliantly crisp potato bits. The watermelon gazpacho was tasty and very addictive, and I&#39;d definitely order it again... if I do go back. The seafood paella was popular with some, though the seafood taste got a bit overpowering by the 4-5 spoonful. Mushroom croquettas? Brilliant. Creamy, practically fall apart croquettas with a strong distinct mushroom taste. Really good. But better than a good creamy jamon croquetta?

Juice, milk, coffee, and tea were also available. Our server came by to take our orders for the hot menu items once we were done with the self serve items. We ordered an omelet and smoked salmon eggs benedict. <br><br>When the eggs came out we were surprised to find a small omelet and a very small eggs benedict dish. When I order benedicts, I expect an order to have two. However, Spago only gives one...kind of strange in my opinion. A few minutes after receiving those hot items, we got the bill slapped onto our table. I understand that they are busy and are trying their best to get hotel guests in and out of the dining area, but come on. <br><br>The smoked salmon eggs benedict was delicious albeit shameful for such a fancy place (but had a superb buttery flavor). The omelet was your typical omelet with whatever meats and veggies you wanted to add.

Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good.

I don&#39;t think so. <br><br>The bak chor mee (minced pork Noodles) is ok. Nothing to scream about. I had the $8 dry version with mee pok (flat yellow egg noodles). Good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat (sliced pork, minced pork, sliced liver, gyoza and deep fried fish (ti po)). A dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms. The black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good. <br><br>There is a ji chai soup for $6 which in my mind is way over priced. Dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee. Can skip without missing anything. <br><br>A good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar. This place missed out on the mushroom. <br><br>Presentation wise, tai Hwa has it better than others. The over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye. Remember it still has a lot of carbs. <br><br>My suggestion is to go at off peak times, order the $6 dry or soup version and if wait is longer than 30 mins, come back another time.',8,'2018-01-29 16:00:01','2018-01-29 16:00:01',7),(1170,44,912,'One of the two hawker food stalls awarded a Michelin star!

Upon receiving the bill, I had noticed two additional charges for &#34;Pickle&#34; (which I then learned was the peanut dish) and another for &#34;Towel &amp; Tea&#34;. Basically they bring out these items to your table without you ordering them, letting customers assume that they are ¬†free items, which they then try and charge you for. We did not touch the peanuts or the tea, so I had asked them to remove the charges (To their credit, the charges were removed). The point is this; a well run establishment shouldn&#39;t play these types of games just to make a couple extra bucks from their customers. It&#39;s not good business practice and I&#39;m sure over the years, they&#39;ve fooled many unsuspecting customers. Long story short...

The shiro negi enhance the whole bowl which makes every bite so delicious. We had Grade A3 Sirloin (100g) in Sukiyaki style ($78) and Blackmore Ranch 220g ($85) as well.

So maybe it&#39;s not that unknown after all.<br><br>Price wise, I think it&#39;s one of the hawker centers that have not had ridiculous inflation, you can still find eats for $2-$3. Don&#39;t forget it&#39;s located in a really central location, so this is rare. There&#39;s good spice carrot cake ($1.50, 2, 3 4), which I&#39;ve grown up eating. There&#39;s also another carrot cake stall that&#39;s not bad, though it has been closed for a while. There&#39;s also the famous big prawn noodle, though I&#39;m not so hot on that. A lor mee stall just opened, that&#39;s not bad, though portions have been shrinking rapidly. The chicken rice store is also extremely popular, but I think it&#39;s by virtue of being around super long, and growing into a habitual taste. It&#39;s only so-so. I dabao it home for dinner every week too. Good kuehs and pancakes to buy as well, but I forget which stall. I always ask for the corner piece :)<br><br>Just try everything man. I usually spend 3h there, starting with meesiam (most would say it&#39;s so-so only, but I like its super lightness :P), lormee/fishball noodles, carrot cake, giam tao roti and whatever else I feel like eating that day. It&#39;s a super dynamic place. Some stalls come (watch out for even 1.50 promotions lol, happened a few times this year), some go, some branch out, the staples stay... not too many stalls that it&#39;s overwhelming. Love this place. Also, they have some bazaar with stalls selling random stuff every month.

These are so tasty it&#39;s ridonkulous. <br>Eat them dumplings up, and keep a little of the oil and vinegar mix so you can dump it in the...<br><br>Double boiled chicken soup with noodles.<br>This is the one where the noodles and the soup come separate. The noodles are dry, in a bowl with spring onion and salt, and you&#39;re supposed to pour in some soup. BUT WAIT. We have that awesome vinegar chili oil mix still left over. POUR THAT IN. Spoon in 2-3 spoons of soup. And SAVOUR.<br><br>Also definitely worth trying is the Shanghai drunken chicken. PACKED with flavour, this is my favourite cold starter item on the menu.<br><br>Also generally well liked is the prawn pancake, which is crisp, seafoody goodness.<br><br>OMG I need some XLB right now.',8,'2013-06-30 16:00:01','2013-06-30 16:00:01',14),(2029,97,1406,'Hello soupy dumpling you are so amazing and I can&#39;t believe I ate almost two orders on my own.

I got to the point, even when there were empty shells, I picked it up with my chopsticks, put it in my mouth, and sucked all the sauce and juices because it was that dam good. I only stopped because my mouth was burning since it gets a bit spicy. For a person that doesn&#39;t like clams to do that, I don&#39;t think I need to say anymore. <br><br>The crab also was amazing. The pepper slowly builds up and combined with the spice from the clams, I was constantly reaching back for the bee hoon to drown out the spice. Still didn&#39;t match the first crab we had at Sin Huat Seafood, but was better than the New Ubin Seafood one. So #2 out of three really good crabs.
